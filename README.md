# DeathStar

DeathStar is a tool to loadtest web based services and rest APIs in a easy, automated and quick way without spending much time on infrastructure setup for load generation. DeathStar expects a configuration file with the details of the attack targets and it takes care of the infrastructure, spawns an ephemeral infrastreucture to carry out the loadtest on the target, generates the result and then tears down the infrastructure. Hence, the developer or the operations engineer does not have to think about the infrastructure for carrying out the attack/test. All that is exepcted from the user is to provide the config file.

## What is the need to such a tool
